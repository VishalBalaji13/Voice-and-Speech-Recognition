These divisions were initially called ju (Korean: \uc8fc; Hanja: \u5dde) in Unified Silla and Later Baekje, and there were nine in total. After Goryeo conquered these states in the 10th century, twelve divisions called mok (\ubaa9; \u7267) were established, although they were reorganized into ten do (\ub3c4; \u9053) in the 11th century.\nAfter Joseon's conquest of Goryeo, it established the Eight Provinces in 1413. These provincial boundaries closely reflected major regional and dialect boundaries, and are still significant in contemporary Korea. In 1895, as part of the Gabo Reform, the country was redivided into 23 districts (Bu; \ubd80; \u5e9c), which were replaced a year later by thirteen new provinces. The thirteen provinces of 1896 included three of the original eight provinces, with the five remaining original provinces divided into north and south halves (Bukdo (\ubd81\ub3c4; \u5317\u9053) and Namdo (\ub0a8\ub3c4; \u5357\u9053) respectively). The thirteen provinces remained unchanged throughout the Japanese colonial period.\nWith the liberation of Korea in 1945, the Korean peninsula was divided into North Korea and South Korea, with the dividing line established along the 38th parallel. Three provinces\u2014Hwanghae, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon (Kangw\u014fn)\u2014were modified or split as a part of this. The special cities of Seoul (South Korea) and P'y\u014fngyang (North Korea) were formed in 1946. Between 1946 and 1954, five new provinces were created: Jeju in South Korea, and North and South Hwanghae, Chagang, and Ryanggang in North Korea. With the freezing of the Korean War in 1953, provincial boundaries were again modified between the two Koreas, and have since remained mostly unchanged; new cities and special administrative regions have since been created in their provinces.\n\n\n== Provinces of Unified Silla ==\n\nThe Korean peninsula was mostly unified for the first time by the state Silla in the 7th century. Silla's capital was Geumseong (now Gyeongju). It had five sub-capitals (\uc18c\uacbd; \u5c0f\u4eac; sogyeong) at Geumgwan-gyeong (\uae08\uad00\uacbd, now Gimhae), Namwon-gyeong (\ub0a8\uc6d0\uacbd, Namwon), Seowon-gyeong (\uc11c\uc6d0\uacbd, Cheongju), Jungwon-gyeong (\uc911\uc6d0\uacbd, Chungju), and Bugwon-gyeong (\ubd81\uc6d0\uacbd, Wonju).\nThe country was divided into nine provinces (\uc8fc; ju): three in the pre-660 territory of Silla, and three each in the territories of the former kingdoms Baekje and Goguryeo.\n\n\n== Provinces of Goryeo ==\n\nGoryeo was established in the 10th century, and had its capital at Gaegyeong (now Kaesong). It conquered Silla and Later Baekje, and also conquered parts of the former territory of Goguryeo. Goryeo had three subcapitals: Donggyeong (now Gyeongju), Namgyeong (now Seoul), and Seogyeong (now Pyongyang).\nGoryeo reorganized its provinces several times. Originally, the country had one royal district (\uae30\ub0b4; \u757f\u5167; ginae) around Gaegyeong and twelve administrative districts (\ubaa9; \u7267; mok). In 995, the twelve districts were redivided into ten provinces (\ub3c4; \u9053; do). In 1005, the ten provinces were again redivided, this time into five provinces and two frontier districts (\uacc4; \u754c; gye). Gyojudo later became its own province after 1178, making it six provinces and two frontier districts.\n\n\n== Provinces of Joseon ==\n\n \n\nIn 1413, Korea (at that time called Joseon) was divided into eight provinces: Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, Jeolla, Hamgy\u014fng (originally called Yeonggil), Hwanghae (originally called P'unghae), and P'y\u014fngan.\n\n\n=== Districts of Late Joseon period ===\nIn 1895, Korea was redivided into 23 districts (Bu; \ubd80; \u5e9c), each named for the city or county that was its capital. The districts were short-lived, however, as the following year, the provincial system was restored.\n\n\n== Provinces of the Korean Empire ==\nIn 1896, the former eight provinces were restored, with five of them (Chungcheong, Gyeongsang, Jeolla, Hamgy\u014fng, and P'y\u014fngan) being divided into North and South Provinces (Bukdo (\ubd81\ub3c4; \u5317\u9053) and Namdo (\ub0a8\ub3c4; \u5357\u9053) respectively). The resulting system of thirteen provinces lasted until the Division of Korea in 1945.\nThe thirteen provinces were: North and South Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, North and South Gyeongsang, North and South Hamgy\u014fng, Hwanghae, North and South Jeolla, and North and South P'y\u014fngan.\n\n\n== Provinces of Ch\u014dsen ==\n\nUnder Colonial Japanese rule, Korean provinces of Korean Empire, remained much the same, only taking on the Japanese reading of the hanja. The Provinces of Ch\u014dsen were:\n\n\n== Provincial divisions since the division of Korea ==\n\nAt the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into Northern Korea and Southern Korea under trusteeship of the Soviet Union and the United States. The peninsula was divided at the 38th parallel in 1945. In 1948, the two zones became the independent countries of North Korea and South Korea.\nThree provinces\u2014Hwanghae, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon\u2014were divided by the 38th parallel.\n\nMost of Hwanghae Province belonged to the Northern zone. The southern portion became part of Gyeonggi Province in the south.\nMost of Gyeonggi Province belonged to the Southern zone. In 1946, the northern portion became part of Hwanghae Province in the north.\nGangwon Province was divided roughly in half, to form modern-day Gangwon Province in South Korea and Kangwon Province in North Korea. The northern province is expanded in 1946 to include some area around the city of Wonsan (Originally part of South Hamgyong Province)\nAlso in 1946, the cities of Seoul in the south and Pyongyang in the north separated from Gyeonggi and South Pyongan Provinces respectively to become Special Cities. Both North Korea and South Korea have subsequently upgraded other cities to a level equal to a province, and these cities (special cities of North Korea and special cities of South Korea [qq.v.]) are sometimes counted along with provinces.\nFinally, the new provinces of Jeju Province (in the south, in 1946) and Chagang Province (in the north, 1949) were formed, from parts of South Jeolla and North Pyongan respectively. In 1954, Ryanggang Province was split from South Hamgyong and Hwanghae was divided into North and South Hwanghae Provinces.\nThe following table lists the present provincial divisions in the Korean Peninsula.\n\nNotes\n1 See Names of Seoul.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of South Korean regions by GDP\nList of provinces of Balhae\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nNahm, Andrew C.
